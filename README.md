# Calculator
This calculator fits the criteria and performs the same function as an everyday calculator. This calculator consists of the buttons from 0-9, all 4 types of operations including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It also includes a big text field for your output, a clear text field button and even a power button. This calculator has the abilities to produce and work with decimals and is programmed to do so. When it comes to the source and coding for this calculator, we included using switch case to make the code nice and simple. All the operations are done in the text field of this design. Some additional features that were added to this project were images from the internet to enhance to UI of this calculator. Another additional feature we added was whatever operation you click it shows what operation you would use at the top of the calculator. For example, If I clicked + it would say addition at the top. We found colours and images that were user friendly and what was appealing for users.
